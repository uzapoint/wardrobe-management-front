### Wardrobe Management System - Frontend

Welcome to the frontend of the Wardrobe Management System! This application enables users to manage their clothing inventory effortlessly.

### Features

- **View Clothes**: Users can view all the clothes stored in the system.
- **Add Clothes**: Easily add new clothing items to your wardrobe.
- **Edit Clothes**: Modify existing clothing details as necessary.
- **Delete Clothes**: Remove unwanted clothing items from the inventory.

### Technology Stack

This frontend is built using **Vue.js** and utilizes **Axios** for making API calls to the Laravel backend. 

### Design Philosophy

My design focuses on **simplicity** and **ease of use**, ensuring that all users can navigate and maintain their wardrobe with minimal effort.

### Authentication

Certain routes in the application require user authentication. These routes will be inaccessible until the user has successfully logged in.

### API Configuration

You can easily configure the API calls by changing the base URL to match your backend application. 

- If you are using **Homestead** for your Laravel backend as well as considering how you set it up, the URL is:
  - [http://wardrobe-management-system.test:8000](http://wardrobe-management-system.test:8000)

- If you are not using Homestead, you can use the following URL instead:
  - [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Feel free to modify the API URL according to your environment for optimal functionality.
